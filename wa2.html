<h1>Weekly Assingment 2</h1>
<p>
	Recently there has been a lot of buzz surrounding the publicly-traded company Gamestop and the potential of a short squeeze. The excitement stems from many events in the past where wall street screwed over the common person and gets away with it. The difference this time is many people have banded together to take on these multi-billionaires because of the ridiculous plays they tried to making shorting Gamestop.
</p>
<p>	
	When most people look back on what makes this potential to hurt Wall Street so personal was the 2008 house bubble pop. Wall Street was bundling subprime loans that didn’t sell together with other prime loans that didn’t sell to then resell them as a triple-A bond. This would cause many to then buy this bond even though the loans building it was way less than optimal. This would then lead to the 2008 marker crash leading to 8 million people laid-off and 6 million homeless. The reason the general population was in outrage was because of the amount of corruption that was allowed to be overlooked as well as almost no change in regulation for these banks. When all was said and done only one man went to jail.

	Events like the 2008 market crash should have lead to many new regulations and checks on the 1%. They should have never been allowed to sell the American dream of owning a home to the people knowing that how they were doing it was built on flimsy, bound to fail loans. The policy changes I would love to see are any policies that take away the leverage these elites have when making money versus the common man. You can see how much power they have with the current situation with Gamestop. The main investment company that was shorting GME, Citron, owned 40% of the trading app Robinhood. Many users who were trying to make Citron bleed billions of dollars were on this app. So Citron made Robinhood not allow users to buy any more shares of GME to help tank the stock price and save billions of dollars they otherwise would not have been able to. This is market manipulation at its finest. I would love to see a policy in place that would look at this as soon as it happened and call the 1% who made this happen held accountable. It angers me seeing that this obvious corruption these elitists have is going unchecked and with very minimal repercussions.

	This is not what I have learned as an information science student to do with the data science mindset. This way of controlling the market does only allows for a controlled mindset not allowing innovation with a growth mindset. The 1% are very mad that the common man has found a way to hit back at them by joining together to support the stock. They were so used to sitting on their high horses to where that they got caught with their pants down. This also goes against the hacker ethic information or data scientists use. This mindset is all about sharing and being open to new ideas. The hedge funds have long been used to never having resistance on the moves they make keeping the poor poor and the rich rich. They don’t want any change in their markets and will never share their earnings with those who could use it. The amount of greed and selfishness these people at the top have makes them unwilling to be open to new ideas that could benefit all. They are only looking out on how to make their billion dollars make another billion.
</p>
<p>
	In conclusion, I love that a community banded together to try and give Wall Street some of their own medicine. Wall Street has done many things to hurt the American people with almost no repercussions for too long. This was blatantly obvious with the 2008 housing bubble and now with the market manipulation with GME and robinhood. This has gotten so much attention that I hope and believe this will lead to more regulations and policies put into place to help even out the playing field between the 1% and everyone else. With being an information science student knowing what it means to have a data science mindset I hope this will also lead to openness to change from the old ways. I would love to see a growth mindset play out to move on from the current policies put in place to share more of the benefits to all people rather than those at the top.
