<p class="paragraphs"> I am currently an Information Science undergrad working towards an Information Science degree and a minor in business. Iâ€™m also an honor student here at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am interested to solve complex problems with data gathering and presenting them to businesses or people that would benefit from the gained knowledge. I love to look deeper into things to see how and why they are that way.</p></p>
