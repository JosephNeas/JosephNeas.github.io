        If I were presenting my work to a data scientist, I would use my python expertise to do so. This is because it would be easiest for them and me to do so as they work a lot with programming languages themselves. There would be no real confusion when I explain my data and how I got it if I were to use python to show them my results. I would also rather present my data going through python and jupyter notebooks as it is the one-stop-shop for all I would need to present my results. I could query, clean, and visualize the data all in jupyter notebooks.

        If I was presenting my work in a corporate setting in a meeting setting I would use what I know with reveal js to present. This is because I feel for this type of setting and audience, the easiest way to get across what I am presenting is through a slide show. In my mind, this is going to be a business meeting where each slide will show the different charts of their companyâ€™s statistics. I could incorporate these charts myself right into Reveal JS that I could then further explain with things such as vertical slides.

       The last audience I think of is a potential job employer. This is already a project that we did in class this year, which is to set up a portfolio website that looks modern and clean through the software CSS. Being an Information Science major, I have been practicing the past three years my coding skills and improving to continually get better. The jobs I would expect to get from a major like this would like to see how much knowledge I have with all the different coding I have done. To convey this I would like a professional-looking portfolio website and through its aesthetics to show how good I am at coding. If I have a website that looks subpar, that would reflect poorly to many of the job recruiters despite having many projects that show my coding expertise.
