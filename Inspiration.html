        <h5> Websites that inspired me: </h5>
          <div class="container">
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://harrisonjansma.com/">Harrison Jansma</a> The choice and simple design gives it a modern fell and look to his site. Love that he included things like the sliders to showcase his confidence with each of his skills and the time line on his about me page showing how he got where he is. It is super easy to navigate through the site with the sticky navigation bar following you as you move down the page. Favorite part about this site is his name is also in the navigation bar adding more of a sense of authority and reminder whose website you are on.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="http://www.emilyridge.ie/">Emily Ridge</a> I like this one because of the subtle background images that make the website pop with the green and white color contrast. The portfolio page is what stands out most to me with this website as it showcases all she has done. Her portfolio has all of her projects in a grid to which you can then click on to be taken to that specific project. This is something I will eventually want to do.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://davidventuri.com/">David Venturi</a> Really like the big headers he uses for each of his pages throughout the website. Makes it feel a lot more is going on while navigating through the site. Again, like Harrison, like how he put his name in the top left of the website. Something I noticed after looking Davids site is that he has a navigation bar at the bottom of each of his pages. Wouldn't think to do that, but this is a great alternative to the sticky or fixed top navigation bar.
