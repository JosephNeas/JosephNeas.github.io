<p class="Essay"> The underrepresentation of women in Hollywood has been a prominent issue for quite some time. Only recently has this been starting to change as more people become aware of this problem. A show like the Simpsons can help give a glimpse into how males are represented versus females. I will use this <a style="color:DodgerBlue; "href="https://github.com/toddwschneider/flim-springfield/blob/master/analysis/data/character_genders.csv" target="_blank">dataset</a> that gives a list of all the characters that have been on the Simpsons and their gender.</p>

<p class="Essay">The Simpsons depicts a family of two males, the father and son, and two females, the mother, and daughter. The main characters fit into the standard Hollywood family with both genders as lead roles. Both genders are represented, just not equally. When looking at every character that has been on the show, there is a 78% chance that the character will be a male. Out of the 323 characters, 252 of them are male (shown in the graph). Women are underrepresented when looking at the entire list of characters.</p>

<p class="Essay"> The Simpsons are one example of this problem in Hollywood. There are and have been many tv shows or movies that have a lack of female representation. The bigger problem with this is the pay gap that comes from this and the more limited roles women could fill. Men tend to receive substantially more money despite having women the same amount of screen time or both as lead roles.
</p>

<p class="Essay"> It is a slow process to change the old habits of Hollywood, but there is progress being made. Women are becoming more and more represented across the film industry. In the year 2019, women as the lead roles went up a percent from 36 to 37%. This is progress in the right direction. Obviously, some movies will have more lead roles as men and others as women, but when looking at the broader picture, there should be more of a balance. 
</p>

<p class="Essay"> The Simpsons, being one of the longest-running tv shows for good reason, can give a glimpse into the old thinking of Hollywood underrepresenting women. The past decade has been great about bringing this problem to light as well as the significant pay gaps. We seem to be moving in the right direction taking baby steps at a time slowly working towards an equal spotlight for men and women in Hollywood.
